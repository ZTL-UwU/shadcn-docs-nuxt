## Images

::stack
  ::div{class="p-4"}
  ![Image](/prose-img/light.png)
  ::

  ```md
  ![Image](/prose-img/light.png)
  ```
::

### Lifted Image

A lifted image is an image that has border and shadow, making it stand out more.

::stack
  ::div{class="p-4"}
  ![Lifted Image](/prose-img/light.png){lifted}
  ::

  ```md
  ![Lifted Image](/prose-img/light.png){lifted}
  ```
::

### Color Mode Image

A color mode image is an image that changes based on the current color mode (light or dark). This is useful for images that have different colors in light and dark mode.

::stack
  ::div{class="p-4"}
    ::color-mode-image
    ---
    srcLight: /prose-img/light.png
    srcDark: /prose-img/dark.png
    alt: Color Mode Image
    ---
    ::
  ::

  ```mdc
  ::color-mode-image
  ---
  srcLight: /prose-img/light.png
  srcDark: /prose-img/dark.png
  alt: Color Mode Image
  ---
  ::
  ```
::

### Image Zooming

Images can be zoomed in by clicking on them. This feature is enabled by default. You can disable it by setting `main.imageZoom` to `false` in the app config to disable zooming globally, or setting `:zoom="false"` on the image itself.

::stack
  ::div{class="p-4"}
  ![No Zooming Image](/prose-img/light.png){:zoom="false"}
  ::

  ```md
  ![No Zooming Image](/prose-img/light.png){:zoom="false"}
  ```
::
